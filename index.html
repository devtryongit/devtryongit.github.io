        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <h3 id="drone"><a href="http://drone4u.eurecom.fr">Drone4u</a></h3>
        <h4><a href="http://www.eurecom.fr/en">Eurecom</a>/<a href="http://www.telecom-paristech.fr/nc/eng">Télécom ParisTech</a> (March - June 2014)</h4>
        <p>Development of autonomous navigation functions for the Parrot’s AR.Drone 2.0, focusing on tracking and following people.</p>
        [<a href="drone.jpg">Image: Drone</a>]
        <p>The first part of the project consisted in the design of a fast and reliable color-based algorithm to track people's t-shirts. Then a piece of software was developed in C/C++ (for Linux), able to process in real-time the images coming from the drone's camera, apply the algorithm to track the person and send back commands based on a well-specified strategy.</p>
        <p>For more details and an overview of the results please watch the video here below <span class="mediaenabler">[<a href="media.html#drone">enable media on this page</a>]</span>.</p>
